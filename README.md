# Physics-Simulations
My own personal playground to learn C++ by implementing physics simulations and visually displaying them with Gnuplot. In order to do this, I am following the textbook "Computational Physics - A Practical Introduction to Computational Physics and Scientific Computing (using C++)" by Konstantinos N. Anagnostopoulos, from the National Technical University of Athens.
